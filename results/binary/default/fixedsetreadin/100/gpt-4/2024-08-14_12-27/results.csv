"&gt; The essence of the entitlement state is government giving away free stuff.  Hence Obamacare would provide insurance for 30 million uninsured, while giving everybody tons of free medical services — without adding “one dime to our deficits,” promised Obama. 
&gt; 
&gt; This being inherently impossible, there had to be a catch.  Now we know it: hidden subsidies.  Toss millions of the insured off their plans and onto the Obamacare “exchanges,” where they would be forced into more expensive insurance packed with coverage they don’t want and don’t need — so that the overcharge can be used to subsidize others.

"So the solution to that is having constant upward pressure by creating money out of nothing that is constantly inflating, since any deflation is catastrophic?  Because that is often the conclusion of the Keynesian/new economics argument that you began. 

People need *wealth* to trade for other *wealth. * But when our central banking system is such that new money can be printed to drive down interest rates (allowing companies to expand and raise wages faster than they would otherwise have been able to) and pay for government programs that fall short in budgeting, the balance is thrown off.  There is new money in the system, but the same amount of wealth.  It works great at first, creating a boom.  But eventually the market catches up with the fact that people are trading more paper money for the same amount of *stuff*, and you have a contraction, or a bust. 

It is often hard to argue against your statement in a populist setting, since what you said is essentially true.  If people have more money, they can spend more money.  But what you have not taken into account is what French economist Frederic Bastiat called ""what is seen and what is unseen. "" I would reccomend reading his essay of the same name and seriously considerin it's implications.  I used to think along the same lines as you until I read it. 

I would also point out that it is small and medium sized businesses that create jobs.  New businesses are therefore the best path to future job creation.  However you seem to be (possibly indirectly) arguing that demand side limitations is what hinders this.  As someone actively trying to start a business right now, I can tell you that demand side has no effect on my business plan, as I only intend to sell my product for $3-10, which is what I believe the market can handle.  Jumping through all the regulatory hoops is killing me though.  Just one quick example out of many: if I want to set up my business as an LLC in order to secure business loans and give myself a layer of protection, in Massachusetts I have to pay a $500 registration fee.  Then *every single year* after that, I would have to pay an additional $500 fee for the privledge of filing my annual report with the state.  This annual report serves noones bennefit but the states, I might add.  

If you want new jobs to be created quickly, remove all the regulations hindering small business development.  And if you don't believe that it's that bad, I would invite you to to ahead and try starting a business yourself.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And, unfortunately, people like this guy are the reason why Morgan Freeman does not believe in God - because people like this guy force you to choose between science and God.   Here is a excerpt from an interview with Morgan Freeman:

----------

Q: Did we invent God? 

A: Yes. 

Q: So there isn't a God up in the sky somewhere.  We came up with God ourselves. 

A: Well, here's a scientific question: Has anybody ever seen hard evidence?  What we get is theories from our earlier prophets.  Now, people who think that God invented us think that the Earth can't be more than 6,000 years old.  So I guess it's a question of belief.  My belief system doesn't support a creator as such, as we can call God, who created us in His/Her/Its image. 

----------

There are millions of people who believe that ""God invented us,"" and also think that the idea of a 6,000 year old Earth is ridiculous.   But those people are drowned out by folks who find that things like evolution uncomfortable and thus reject it, making the faith look foolish by association.   If the loudest proponents of Christianity presented the case for God in a reasonable fashion, and admitted that theism is a matter of *faith*, I think we'd have far fewer atheists than we have by having those proponents insist that we have empirical proof of God, and reject science because it doesn't fit the narrow worldview they've created for Him.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
